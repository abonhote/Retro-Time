Retro Time is a watchface designed for the Pebble smart-watch. It takes design influence from all those 8-bit games we loved as a kid. 

Battery life is displayed as 4 iconic hearts, that depleat as the life of your pebble depleats. Retro Time keeps track of your bluetooth connection status and will give you a gentle reminder if you leave your phone behind.

Retro time can be downloaded on [MyPebleFaces.com](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/apps/12135/7967/) or via my dropbox mirrors (just in case MPF is down).
